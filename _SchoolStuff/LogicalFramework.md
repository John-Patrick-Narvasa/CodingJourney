# 8 Steps to Avoid Brainfarts 

1. List program goals (Desired outputs) (PAPER)

2. List OBJECTIVES and STEPS 
  - Breaking down the problem
  - Recognizing the patterns
  - Forming the formula solution

3. List all NEEDS and TOOLS (Initialize the imports, variables, commands [conditions, loops, DSA]) (IDE)
   - Declare and initialize all variables and sub-variables.
   - Keep your variables organized to avoid clutter.
   - visualize key variables via ARROW POINTERS (my own way of flowcharting).

4. Structurizing (for making bigger scale programs) (IDE)
    - Break down your code into sections: 
     - Intro
     - Housekeeping
     - Functionality
     - End task
   - Use methods and classes for further abstraction.

5. Pseudo code (Sketching) (PAPER)
  - Apply the logic

6. Simulate the Pseudo code (PAPER)
   - Debugging Phase

7. Sketch Key Functionalities (if necessary)
   - Identify and outline the critical functionalities for each logic block.

8. Write code (using IDE)





# Structuring (the IDE itself ONLY)

- **Make a seperate markdown file** for desired outputs (the standard and own understanding)

- **Initialize All Imports**  
  At the top of your file.

- **Declare Variables and Sub-Variables**  
  Group related variables together for clarity.

- **Pseudocode Logic and Arrangement**  
  Outline your approach, including functions, processes, arrays, loops, etc. Consider data structures and algorithms (DSA) during this phase.

- **Redeclare Variables If Necessary**  
  Ensure variables are properly scoped and defined.

- **Separate DISPLAY and LOGIC Blocks**  
  Keep your display logic distinct from business logic to enhance readability.

- **Main FINAL Desired Display Block**  
  Conclude with a clear display of your results, ensuring itâ€™s coherent and organized.
