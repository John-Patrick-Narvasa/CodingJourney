7 steps to avoid brainfuck

1. Type all imports needed and initialize

2. Sketch or Comment the problem and understand it

3. Initialize all variables and sub-variables(if there's any) [organize if getting cluttered]

4. Sketch or Pseudocode the desired outputs

5. Comment the main structuring [intro, housekeeping, functionality, end task] 
(further abstractize using methods and classes)

6. Sketch what key functionalities should be used on each logic

7. Start coding :D (enjoy or jump off a building I guess :D)
