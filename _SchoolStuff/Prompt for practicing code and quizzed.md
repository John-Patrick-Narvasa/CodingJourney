Code exercise (SCHOOL):
    1. Hello, I want you to follow the subject, coverage and prompt mentioned below:

Pseudo programming : (coverage: flowcharts, simulation and expected output (me who makes it) and arithmetics in java, and especially PROBLEM SOLVING regarding the last coverages mentioned with some edge cases) (recursive way, linear way, loop way)

Make a 15-20 items quiz in multiple choice and put the answer key to the last (after all the question items)

Or other way around where I get to code and have the desired result/output (only provide fewer items)

    2. Summarize everything about the quizzes you have made and the edge cases being considered with simple examples along with dissecting its logic of each nature according to the quizzes being made previously in a bullet form

Consider more edge cases
